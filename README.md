# react-tutorial
## A simple tic-tac-toe game implemented using React.js for the client-side and the inbuilt React development server for the (local) server-side. The game also allows you to jump to any previous moves and play from there('time travel').
## This app was made using the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
To run the app, 
1. Install `Node.js` by following online instructions or [these instructions](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment)
(this setup will allow you to build React apps, too. If you simply want to run the app, install only `Node.js` by going to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
or install `nvm` and install `Node.js` using that.)

2. Run `npm start` while in this project's root directory to start a local development server accessible by default at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` i.e `http://localhost:3000` or on the network at `http://192.168.0.8:3000` (these addresses are viewable on the terminal when you start the server)

3. Visit the IP address in your browser and play!
